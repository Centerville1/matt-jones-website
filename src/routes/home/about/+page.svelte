  <h3>Why This Site:</h3>
  <p>My personal portfolio website, a personal web development project 
    designed as a playground to experiment with
    web development, and keep a detailed record of my
    experience and various projects.  This site is, like many old school
    personal websites of the early 2000s,
    meant to be a chance for me to highlight my skills and experience
    and a place that I can keep adding to and tinkering with over time
  </p>

  <h3>Original Project Pitch</h3>
  <p>This will be a personal project to expand my skills with frontend 
    web developmentt.  It will also allow me to create a 
    personal portfolio website to put my experience, side projects, 
    experiments, and anything else I want, in a 
    less formal and far more custom format than 
    on LinkedIn</p>
