# Matt Jones Portfolio Website

## About

This is a personal project to expand my skills with fronted web development, and create a personal portfolio website to put my experience, side projects, experiments, and anything else I want on, in a less formal and much more personalized way than LinkedIn

## Implementation Notes

The project is implemented using SvelteKit, as a simple, responsive, frontend-only webpage.
